## Analysis of longitudinal data: Part I

In this part we will learn to analyze longitudinal data using graphical displays and and the summary measure approach. We'll be using the `RATS` data from a nutrition study for three groups of rats, which treated with different diets. 
Each rat’s body weight was recorded weekly. We are interested in learning whether differences in their diets affected their growth during the observation period.

First, we Read the `RATS` data in long form:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
RATSL <- read.table("data/RATSL.txt", header=TRUE)
```

We also need to check the structure of the variables:

```{r}
str(RATSL)
```

`ID` and `Group` are now assigned to be integers, so we need to change categorical values to factors in RATSL data:

```{r}
RATSL$ID <- as.factor(RATSL$ID)
RATSL$Group <- as.factor(RATSL$Group)
```


We also change `Time` to be numeric 

```{r}
RATSL$Time <- as.numeric(RATSL$Time)
```


### Graphic displays of `RATS` data

We begin with a graphical display of `RATS` data by plotting the points
for each subject to show the weight development of individual rats.

Access library `ggplot2` to create plots

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Access the package ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
```


### Plotting the RATS data


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = Weight, group = ID)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = Group)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Time (days)", breaks = seq(0, 60, 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Weight (grams)") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```
We can see that the average initial weight for each group of rats is  different.

To see the changes in weights more clearly, We can also plot the data separately for each group:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Draw the plot
ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = Weight, linetype = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Group, labeller = label_both) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(RATSL$Weight), max(RATSL$Weight)))
```

We can make a few observations from the data: First, rats' weight seems to be increasing in most of the cases over time in the sample. Second, there are quite large differences between the groups, and the weights between groups do not converge. However, the weights' rate of change does not vary much within each group. However, there rate of change seems to vary between groups, given that the change in weight is larger in groups 2 and 3 than group 1 over the sample.

We can further study the differences and similarities between groups by looking at the standardized data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
# Standardize the variable bprs
RATSL <- RATSL %>%
  group_by(Time) %>%
  mutate(stdWeight = (Weight - mean(Weight))/sd(Weight) ) %>%
  ungroup()
# Glimpse the data
glimpse(RATSL)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Plot again with the standardised bprs
ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = stdWeight, linetype = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Group, labeller = label_both) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Standardized Weight")
```
The above figure plots the standardized data for each group. We can see similar features in the above figure as in the non-standardized data, although differences between rates of changes between different groups is now less prononunced.



```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Number of observation periods
n <- RATSL$Time %>% unique() %>% length()

RATSS <- RATSL %>%
  group_by(Group, Time) %>%
  summarise( mean = mean(Weight), se = sd(Weight)/sqrt(n) ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Glimpse the data
glimpse(RATSS)
summary(RATSS)
```

Now, we have the standard error and the mean of each group included in the dataset, which we can plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Plot the mean profiles
ggplot(RATSS, aes(x = Time, y = mean, linetype = Group, shape = Group)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(1,2,3)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1,2,3)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se, linetype="1"), width=0.3) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9,0.5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight) +/- se(Weight)")
```
The above figure suggests that there are quite large differences between the means of each group as well as the standard errors.

We can also draw a box-plot for each time period:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
RATSL$Time1 <- factor(RATSL$Time, levels = c(1,8,15,22,29,36,43,44,50,57,64))
ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time1, y = Weight, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
The plots suggests that there are some outliers in Group 2. 
 
### Summary graphs

The summary measure method transforms measurements for each subject into a single measure thatcaptures  essential feature of the individual in the sample. In this case, the the summary measure approach is applied to observiations by measuring the average weight after the first day of the trial until the end of the sample. Given that the data is measured at unequal intervals and that we are interested in learning about differences in the growth rate of each group, a regression coefficient would probably be a better measure, but we proceed as instructed.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a summary data by treatment and subject with mean as the summary variable (ignoring baseline day 1).
RATSL1 <- RATSL %>%
  filter(Time > 1) %>%
  group_by(Group, ID) %>%
  summarise( mean=mean(Weight) ) %>%
  ungroup()


# Draw a boxplot of the mean versus treatment
ggplot(RATSL1, aes(x = Group, y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "point", shape=23, size=4, fill = "white") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight), Days 8-64")

```
The above figure shows that the mean weight of Group 2 is more variable and skewed to the right than for other groups. We can also see that there is an outlier in Group 2, which possibly biases the results.

Next we draw a new boxplot that eliminates the outlier in Group 2.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Get rid of the outliers
RATSL11 <- RATSL1 %>%
  filter(mean < 550)

# Draw a boxplot of the mean versus treatment
ggplot(RATSL11, aes(x = Group, y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "point", shape=23, size=4, fill = "white") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "mean(Weight), Days 8-64")
```
The figure confirms that there are significant differences between the means of the groups, but we must confirm this with a statistical test.


### Means testing

We cannot use a t-test two test more than two samples, so ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used test a hypothesis when dealing with two or more groups. One-way ANOVA can be considered an extension of the t-test when at least three groups are tested. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

RATS <- read.table("data/RATS.txt", header=TRUE)

# Add the baseline from the original data as a new variable to the summary data
RATSL111 <- RATSL1 %>%
  mutate(baseline = RATS$WD1)

# Fit the linear model with the mean as the response 
fit <- lm(mean ~ baseline + Group, data = RATSL111)

# Compute the analysis of variance table for the fitted model with anova()
anova(fit)
```
We can see that the p-value for `Group` is less than 0.1, which means that there are differences between the different groups at the 10% confidence level.


## Analysis of longitudinal data: Part II

In this section, we use linear mixed effects models for normal response models to study the effect of two different treatments on schizophrenia. Linear mixed effects models for repeated measures data take in to account that subject’s responses depend on observed and unobserved individual characteristics. The unobserved variables are included in the model as random effects.  

In the `BPRS` data  subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Before the treatment, each subject was rated on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and then during each of the following eight weeks. The BPRS scale is used to evaluate the presence of schizophrenia.

First we load the longitudinal data

```{r}
BPRSL <- read.table("data/BPRSL.txt", header=TRUE)
```

and check the structure:

```{r}
str(BPRSL)
```

We need to change categorical values to factors in BPRSL data

```{r}
BPRSL$treatment <- as.factor(BPRSL$treatment)
BPRSL$subject <- as.factor(BPRSL$subject)
BPRSL$Week <- as.numeric(BPRSL$Week) 
BPRSL$bprs <- as.numeric(BPRSL$bprs)
```

We can look at the differences between Wide form data and long form data. The original wide form data defines a variable for each observation period

```{r, echo=FALSE}
BPRS <- read.table("data/BPRS.txt", header=TRUE) #read original BPRS data
arrange(filter(BPRS,treatment==1 & subject==c(1,2)), subject)
```


However, the long form data defines variables for time and the observations, as can be seen in the table below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
arrange(filter(BPRSL,treatment==1 & subject==c(1,2)), subject)
```
In the plot below, we ignore the repeated-measure nature of the data by abstracting from individuals and only plotting the data by treatment. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = Week, y = bprs, color = treatment)) +
  geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=treatment),hjust=0, vjust=0)
```
We can see that there are no clear differences between the two groups. The bprs measures seem to be decreasing over time in both groups.

If we look at the each subject separately, we can see that individual observations are correlated for each individual, suggesting the presence of random effects.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = Week, y = bprs, linetype = subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ treatment, labeller = label_both) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(BPRSL$bprs), max(BPRSL$bprs)))
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x=Week, y=bprs, linetype=treatment, group=interaction(treatment, subject))) + geom_line()
p2 <- p1 + scale_x_continuous(name = "Time (weeks)", breaks = seq(0, 8, 1)) 
p3 <- p2 + scale_y_continuous(name = "bprs")
p4 <- p3 + theme(legend.position = "right") # "none" in the book
p5 <- p4 + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
p6 <- p5 + ggtitle("BPRS by Treatment")
p6
```

The scatterplot confirms this observation, given that observations for consecutive weeks appear to be strongly correlated.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pairs(BPRS[-c(1,2)])
```

### Fitting Linear Mixed Models to `BRPS` data

#### Independence model

We first estimate the independence model, where the BPRS measure is the independent variable and time and treatment dummy are the explanatory variables and no random effects are assumed.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
BPRSL_model <- lm(bprs ~ Week + treatment, data = BPRSL)

# print out a summary of the model
summary(BPRSL_model)
```
We can see that the treatment dummy is not significant, which would suggest that the treatment does not effect the BPRS measure.

#### Random intercept model

Next we fit a linear model with a random intercept

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# access library lme4
library(lme4)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a random intercept model
BPRSL_RIM <- lmer(bprs ~ Week + treatment + (1 | subject), data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)
# Print the summary of the model
summary(BPRSL_RIM)
```

As can be seen from the results of the regression, the coefficient estimates are similar to those of the independence model, and the intercept and the coefficient for time are both significant, as before. The standard error for time is smaller in the random intercept model than in the independence model, given that assuming independence leads to a larger standard error for within-subject covariates. Surprisingly, the standard error for the  dummy variable is smaller in the random intercept model than in the independence model, given that assuming independence usually reduces the standard error of between-subject coefficients.

#### Random intercept and slope model

Next, we fit a linear model with both a random slope and random intercept.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# create a random intercept and random slope model
BPRSL_RIM1 <- lmer(bprs ~ Week + treatment + (Week | subject), data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)

# print a summary of the model
summary(BPRSL_RIM1)
```

The coefficients are again quite similar as with the independence model and the random intercept model, although the standard error for the treatment dummy is slightly lower than in the random intercept model.

We can perform a likelihood ratio test to compare the models:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# perform an ANOVA test on the two models
anova(BPRSL_RIM1,BPRSL_RIM)
```
The likelihood ratio test for the random intercept model versus the random intercept and slope model gives a chi-squared statistic of 7.2721 with 2 degrees of freedom, which suggests that the random intercept and slope model provides a better fit for the data.


#### Random intercept and slope model with treatment-time interaction

Finally, we fit a random intercept and slope model that allows for interaction between treatment and time. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# create a random intercept and random slope model
BPRSL_RIM2 <- lmer(bprs ~ Week * treatment + (Week | subject), data = BPRSL, REML = FALSE)

# print a summary of the model
summary(BPRSL_RIM2)

# perform an ANOVA test on the two models
anova(BPRSL_RIM2, BPRSL_RIM1)
```
We can see that results are similar to those of the other linear models. The interaction term between treatment and time is not significant, which means that the changes in the rate of change in the bpsr measure does not significantly differ between groups. The likelihood ratio test comparing the random intercept and slope model to the random intercept and slope model with the interaction term shows that the former model provides a slightly better fit for the data.

#### Fitted vs actual data

We can also plot the the fitted values from the interaction model and the actual values from the `BPRS` data.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a vector of the fitted values
Fitted <- fitted(BPRSL_RIM2)

# Create a new column fitted to BPRSL
BPRSL <- BPRSL %>%
  mutate(Fitted)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x=Week, y=bprs, linetype=treatment, group=interaction(treatment, subject))) + geom_line()
p2 <- p1 + scale_x_continuous(name = "Time (weeks)", breaks = seq(0, 60, 20)) 
p3 <- p2 + scale_y_continuous(name = "bprs")
p4 <- p3 + theme(legend.position = "right") # "none" in the book
p5 <- p4 + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
p6 <- p5 + ggtitle("Observed")

p7 <- ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x=Week, y=Fitted, linetype=treatment, group=interaction(treatment, subject))) + geom_line()
p8 <- p7 + scale_x_continuous(name = "Time (weeks)", breaks = seq(0, 60, 20)) 
p9 <- p8 + scale_y_continuous(name = "bprs")
p10 <- p9 + theme(legend.position = "right") # "none" in the book
p11 <- p10 + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
p12 <- p11 + ggtitle("Fitted")

p6;p12
```

The above figure comparing fitted values of the interaction model and the observed values shows that the model fits the actual data quite well. However, the treatment does not appear to have predictive power about the rate of change of the bprs measure.
