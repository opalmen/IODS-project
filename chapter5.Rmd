# RStudio Exercise 5

## Data wrangling

See file `create_human.R` in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/opalmen/IODS-project/tree/master/data)  


## Analysis

First, load the data

```{r, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
human = read.table("data/human.csv", header=TRUE, sep=" ")
```
Access library `GGally`, `corrplot` to be used in the analysis

```{r, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(GGally)
library(corrplot)
library(dplyr)
```

Next we summarize the data
```{r, warning=FALSE}
summary(human)
```
We can see that lowest life expectancy (`Life.Exp`) is 49 years and the highest is 83.5. The data also shows that the share of female participants in parliament (`Parli.F`) varies between countries, ranging from 0 to 57.5 %. On average, females obtain less education than males (`Edu2.Ratio`) and particpate less in the labor force (`LFP.Ratio`)


### Data visualization

Next, we visualize the data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=18}
# visualize the 'human' variables
ggpairs(human)

```

The female-to-male secondary education ratio and labor force participation ratio have a lot of weight on the right tail of the distribution, which suggests that female participation in secondary education and the labor force is high in the sample. Moreover, most countries in the sample are poor, given that the GNI is skewed to the left.

Looking in more detail at the correlations in the figure below, we can see some expected relationships. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=12}

# compute the correlation matrix and visualize it with corrplot
cor(human) %>% corrplot
```
Maternal mortality (`Mat.Mor`) and adolescent fertility rate (`Ado.Birth`) are negatively correlated with relative education of female to male (`Edu2.Ratio`) and gross national income (`GNI`). `GNI` is positively correlated with female education `Edu2.Ratio` and life expectancy (`Life.Exp`) and expected education (`Edu.Exp`).



### Principal components analysis (non-standardized data)

Next we perform principal components analysis (PCA) on the data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# perform principal component analysis
pca_human <- prcomp(human)
summary(pca_human)
```

The above table shows that the first principal component (PC1) explains 99% of the variation in the data, suggesting that the data can be summarized in single dimension.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=12}
biplot(pca_human, choices = 1:2, cex = c(0.8, 1), col = c("grey40", "deeppink2"))
```

The biplot shows that the first principal component explain much of the cross-country variation, which is largely driven by gross national income (`GNI`).

### Principle components analysis (standardized data)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# perform principal component analysis (with the SVD method)
human_std <- scale(human)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# perform principal component analysis (with the SVD method)
pca_human_std <- prcomp(human_std)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=12}
summary(pca_human_std)
```
Using the standardized data, we can see that now the first five principal components explain 92% of the variation in the data, whereas the first principal component explained most of the variation in the non-standardized data.

This can be largely explained by the the large values of the GNI that are driving the results, whereas this is avoided by using the standardized data.

This can be seen clearly in the figure below:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=12}
# draw a biplot of the principal component representation and the original variables
biplot(pca_human_std, choices = 1:2, cex = c(0.8, 1), col = c("grey40", "deeppink2"))
```

We can see that gross national income (`GNI`), female participation in secondary education (`Edu2.Ratio`),  expected years of education (`Edu.Exp`) and life expectancy (`Life.Exp`) have large negative weights on the first principal component (PC1), whereas maternal mortality (`Mat.Mor`) and  adolescent birth rate (`Ado.Birth`) have positive weights on PC1. 

Moreover, female participation in the labor force relative to men (`LFP.Ratio`) and participation in the parliamenet (`Parli.F`) have positive weights on PC2.

### Interpretation of principal components  
The above suggests that PC1 seems to explain economic differences between countries, given that variables associated with economic development, such as gross national income and health have the largest weights on PC1. 

PC2 may be interpreted as a measure of gender inequality, because it is largely driven by female participation in the parliament and relative labor force participation.

### Tea dataset from FactoMineR

Install package `FactoMineR`, load dataset `tea`. The data is on a questionnaire on tea consumption, product perception and personal details.

First, explore that data:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages('FactoMineR', repos = "http://cloud.r-project.org")
library(FactoMineR)
data(tea)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(tea)
str(tea)
```

The data includes 300 observations of 36 variables.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=12}
# visualize the dataset
library(tidyr)
gather(tea) %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + facet_wrap("key", scales = "free") + geom_bar() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8))
```

Next we select the variables of interest: `Tea`, `How`, `how`, `where`, `price`, `age`, and `lunch`

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# column names to keep in the dataset
keep_columns <- c("Tea", "How", "how", "where")

# select the 'keep_columns' to create a new dataset
tea_vars <- select(tea, one_of(keep_columns))
head(tea_vars)
 ```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=12}
# multiple correspondence analysis
mca <- MCA(tea_vars, graph = FALSE)
# summary of the model
summary(mca)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=12}
# visualize MCA
plot(mca, invisible=c("ind"), habillage = "quali")
```

The above figure shows the association between the different categories. Unpackaged tea is consumed in a tea shop, whereas bagged tea is purchased from a chain store. Earl gray tea is more likely to be consumed with milk and black tea with lemon and green tea is consumed alone. 

Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 explain 18,4 % and 17,1% of the variation, respectively. The summary of the model shows that first four dimensions explain roughly 60 percent of the variation in the model.
